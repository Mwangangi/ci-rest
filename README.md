# ci-rest

This is a simplified php rest-server created by extending Codeigniter core classes. 
I have used to for several of my projects and thought it would be of help to someone looking for a quick way to get up and running with a fully RESTful API.

## Setup

### Installing

Clone the project to your projects folder.
```sh
git clone https://github.com/Mwangangi/ci-rest.git
```
cd into the cloned folder

Rename the following files(they are inside application/config folder) as follows:

database-sample.php file to database.php
config-sample.php file to config.php

Edit the files to suit your environment setup and you're set to go!
